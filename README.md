# neural-network-challenge-1
### Utilized the guidance and support of the solution codes provided in class (for neural networks) that enhanced my overall understanding of how the sequential model is applied. I researched the scikit learn website for reference on the f1_score to calculate the binary classification and prediction of the y variable. I am still not sure about the "UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. Use `zero_division` parameter to control this behavior." Will need some further clarification about the issue noted. Perhaps it has to be related to the zeros presented under the 'precision,' 'recall,' and 'f1_score' categories? Additionally, the support values range between 1 and 3. Is that the normal parameter set for the results presented? Very curious on how that differs from the original output that featured triple digits in the hundreds, unless it's completely different per user experience. Moreover, the last reference mentioned below helped me understand the classification results' formatting and presentation.
